# Alzheimer detection using a Convolutional Neural Network
Data Science Thesis done by Fernando Herr√°n Albelda

### Objective
The goal of this thesis is to build a Convolutional Neural Network to classify patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or cognitively normal (CN) using their magnetic resonance images (MRI).

### Requirements
Next libraries are used in the code:
- [nibabel](https://nipy.org/nibabel/)
- [deepbrain](https://pypi.org/project/deepbrain/)
- [cv2](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d0/de3/tutorial_py_intro.html)
- [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials)
- Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
- Others: os, sys, time, numpy, pandas, random, scipy, shutil, sklearn,tqdm, functools, skimage, gzip

### Set-up environment
In order to run the code without having dependencies problems, user can create a virtual conda environment with all needed packages. To do that, please follow process below: 
- Download `tfm_env.yml` file found in this master branch.
- Open terminal, and run below command. It will create an environment in your computer.

```
conda env create -f tfm_env.yml
```
